=== An Interactive Music Experience Beyond Your Wildest Imagination!
===  By Mister Teejay VanSlyke!

== Getting Started!

Clef is an interactive music programming language.  To install, type 

    sudo gem install teejayvanslyke-clef  # that's me!

Clef is a client-server application.  Ooooh.  It's so fancy.  That means 
you'll want to type

    clef_server

in one terminal window, and

    clef

in another!
